# Lunar Sample detection 
## Problem Statement
The aim of our project is to evaluate lunar samples quickly and effectively before or during the mission,While differentiating samples of potential scientific value from less interesting material.

## Objective

### 1. To increase the scientific and engineering value of each unmanned lunar mission by assessing lunar samples in-situ before or during the mission
### 2. Only collecting those samples or parts of samples that are of highest value to the specific mission.
### 3. Reducing the cost of Lunar Missions.

## Our Proposed System

We will build machine learning solution where it studies the difference of the lunar samples by :
1. First segmenting the landscape to identify areas of interest
2. Analyse the sample using onboard instruments 
3. Passing these the ML algorithm which will return the type of mineral so that we can consider whether or not to include it.
